# Deep-Rock-Save-Transfer

## First Time Setup
You need to select this option before the others so the program knows the directory of your save files.

Xbox saves will look like this: **C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Packages/CoffeeStainStudios.DeepRockGalactic_496a1srhmar9w/SystemAppData/wgs/000901F65C522477_882901006F2042808DB0569531F199CB/2F45AE0E95E949E8B1DC71E0BB692368

Steam saves will look like this: **D:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Deep Rock Galactic/FSD/Saved/SaveGames

After selecting the proper directories, DRST will prompt you to select a backup folder or create a new one. Upon each save transfer, the original saves of both the Xbox and Steam versions will be copied into a new folder within the folder you chose. This ensures that if anything goes wrong, you will still have the original save files for restoration.
