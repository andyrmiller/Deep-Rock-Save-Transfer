This is a simple program that makes transferring saves between the Xbox PC and Steam versions much simpler. There are a few things you need to do upon downloading:

## First Time Setup
You need to select this option before the others so the program knows the directory of your save files.

### Xbox saves will look like this:
- ***C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Packages/CoffeeStainStudios.DeepRockGalactic_496a1srhmar9w/SystemAppData/wgs/
000901F65C522477_882901006F2042808DB0569531F199CB/2F45AE0E95E949E8B1DC71E0BB692368***

### Steam saves will look like this:

- ***D:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Deep Rock Galactic/FSD/Saved/SaveGames***

### Set a backup folder.

After selecting the proper directories, DRST will prompt you to select a backup folder or create a new one. Upon each save transfer, the original saves of both the Xbox and Steam versions will be copied into a new folder within the folder you chose. This ensures that if anything goes wrong, you will still have the original save files for restoration.

## Transfering Saves

From here, it's a breezy three click process. Choose the direction you're transferring and select the corresponding save files from each folder. 

### Steam save files will look like *76561198207771097_Player.sav*
![UI_steamsave_arrow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53543020/148181689-a0c0f672-6ad1-4822-9159-c60534b7d592.png)

### Xbox save files will look like *27CBC55625D54C7B8D7D16A4D95F52A3*
![UI_xboxsave_arrow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53543020/148181691-688d0b9f-6152-44d3-8f76-f4bbaaa6ca9e.png)

After selecting both files, they will be copied to a new sub-folder in your designated backups folder. Once the transfer is complete, you'll get a confirmation message. That's it! Happy mining!
